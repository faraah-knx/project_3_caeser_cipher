# project_3_caeser_cipher
a simple C program that encodes and decodes messages by using the ceasar cipher  
Objective✨

To create a simple program to encode and decode messages using the Caesar Cipher, handling both uppercase and lowercase letters.


Features💫

Message encoding and decoding.
Supports uppercase and lowercase letters.
Reads full sentences without changing spaces or symbols.
Shift value (shift) controlled between 1 and 25.


Methodology👾

User inputs the operation, message, and shift value.
Program processes the message character by character.
Applies encryption/decryption using modulo 26 for letters.
Displays the final result.


Key Concepts:😶‍🌫️

Loops and conditions (for, if / else).
Conversion between characters and  values.
Arithmetic operations for encryption and decryption.


Conclusion💣

This project demonstrates the basics of cryptography, character manipulation, and logic implementation in C.
